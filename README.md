A mod allowing you to pilot zoe in first person!

You can enable and disable it in settings.

The mod piggy backs off of the in game first person toggle on playerdata.

There is an issue where if the mod activates when the entering from the main menu animation plays or on the shard exit animation it bugs out and disables player movement. I worked around this by just delaying the activation by 4 seconds when on the hub scene, but if this is a problem lmk! you can msg me on discord: ricowilliams
